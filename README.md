## Project information 

Created a functioning customer entry form for a website. For MVP, the form requires the customer's name, email address, and zip
code. It follows UX best practices by including validation and showing helpful error
messages to aid in completing the form.

## Project usage

1. The application should displays a form containing a name input (type=text), an email
address input (type=email), a zip code input (type=number), and a button labelled
Submit.
2. Name must be at least 3 characters 
3. Email must be in valid email format of john@email.com, 
4. Zip code must be valid and in proper zip code format (ex.12345), 
5. When you submit a valid form, a message should appear to indicate that the form
was successfully "submitted" and the input values are reset (note: the form should not
actually submit).
